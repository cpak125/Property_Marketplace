# PropR

A full-stack CRUD application that joins property sellers and buyers under a single platform. There are 3 different "portals" (seller, buyer, and admin) that a user can be directed to after logging in, each offering its own distinct features. Users can sign up as a buyer or seller. As a seller you are able to view, create, edit, and delete your property listings. As a buyer you are able to search for property listings to add to your "wishlist". As the admin user you are able to view various stats and figures related to user information and the property listings.
