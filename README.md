# PropR

A full-stack CRUD application that joins property sellers and buyers under a single platform. There are 3 different "portals" (seller, buyer, and admin) that a user can be directed to after logging in, each offering its own distinct features. Users can sign up as a buyer or seller. As a seller you are able to view, create, edit, and delete your property listings. As a buyer you are able to view all property listings and add any to your "wishlist".
